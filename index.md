# Wink

Hacking Illini project for OHI/O 2020.

Wink is an app designed to help users develop good sleeping and working habits via gamification.

## So, how does it work?

Wink is extremely simple! Each user gets an (adorable) virtual pet and is tasked with the responsibility of looking after it.

The pet gets happier and healthier if the user does not use their phone during the designated sleeping/working hours.
Alternatively, it gets incrementally unhappy and uncomfortable if the user is on their phone during the no-no times.
